# Daily R Dose - A Year of Continuous R
Personalizing R with Simone and Patrick

## Day 1 (10/27/21):  Github workflow.  

Clone our Daily R Dose repo.  Before you do, [first read this page](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html) for how to setup RStudio with an existing GitHub repo.

Then do the following after you setup a new project with the following URL:

https://github.com/pem725/Daily.R.Dose.git

`gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`

Now, copy your PAT to the console and hit enter.  Make sure it works by editing the README.md file and then commit the changes and then push them to GitHub.

## Day 2 (10/28/21):  Create a new file and sync it.

In short, make a new file that will be included in the GitHub repo online AND in your local git repo (on your computer).  Once you have created the file, merge it to your local git and the github repo by committing the changes.  There are a ton of points and clicks that follow BUT you can also do it by code using the `usethis()` function.  

You do it and then paste your code below.

<SCM, insert your code here>

## Day 3 (10/29/21): Open a new session and project...

We will have two projects going simultaneously AT ALL TIMES with this tutorial.  Open this project as the small one and then another as instructed.  I want you to open the [NRL project repo](https://github.com/pem725/NRL2021-MCINC.git) and, if you have not already done so, make sure you have it connected as you did on Day 1 (and 2).

Just to be clear, you need the following URL to clone the repo to your local system:

https://github.com/pem725/NRL2021-MCINC.git

## Day 4 (10/30/21):  Browse the NRL and...

...type what you edited here.  Commit the changes to your local repo and the GitHub repo and report the update to me via email.

## Day 5 (10/31/21):  Create an NRL scratch sheet

In programming, we typically have multiple files that serve as temporary files to help us sort out code before we merge it into the big project.  These files include the following:

[Scratch file](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/scratch-file)

[Sandbox](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/sandbox)

Here, I want you to create an SCM scratch file that is clearly named and documented to be YOURS and nobody elses.  Why do you merge said file with the rest of the repo?  Usually so that you don't have to worry about losing your work.  Give it a go.  Create a scratch file for yourself, commit the changes to the repo and push the changes to the GitHub repo.

## Day 6 (11/1/21):
