# Daily.R.Dose
Personal R with Simone and Patrick

## Day 1:  Github workflow.  

Clone our Daily R Dose repo.  Before you do, [first read this page](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html) for how to setup RStudio with an existing GitHub repo.

Then do the following after you setup a new project with the following URL:

https://github.com/pem725/Daily.R.Dose.git

`gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`

Now, copy your PAT to the console and hit enter.

## Day 2:  Create a new file and merge it to your local git and the github repo.
