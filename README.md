# Daily.R.Dose
Personal R with Simone and Patrick

## Day 1 (10/27/21):  Github workflow.  

Clone our Daily R Dose repo.  Before you do, [first read this page](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html) for how to setup RStudio with an existing GitHub repo.

Then do the following after you setup a new project with the following URL:

https://github.com/pem725/Daily.R.Dose.git

`gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`

Now, copy your PAT to the console and hit enter.  Make sure it works by editing the README.md file and then commit the changes and then push them to GitHub.

SCM edits to the ReadMe here. Did I actually get it to work?!


## Day 2 (10/28/21):  Create a new file and sync it.

In short, make a new file that will be included in the GitHub repo online AND in your local git repo (on your computer).  Once you have created the file, merge it to your local git and the github repo by committing the changes.  There are a ton of points and clicks that follow BUT you can also do it by code using the `usethis()` function.  

You do it and then paste your code below.

<SCM, insert your code here>
